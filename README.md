Fitness Registration System 

A basic outline of what we discussed with Amy & Nicole

Homepage
------------------

### Monthly calendar

* What classes are  and when
 * Color code along with name the type of classes.
* How full the class is
* A little bit about the class  (like an info button with a pop out/modal) ooh I like the sounds of that!
* Feedback button             
 * to email both Nicole and I(?) (possible modal window to provide feedback for a particular class) and in general.

Log in 
------------------

### Employees
* What classes you have signed up for (list items with the dates and time, option to cancel attendance) Yes and I like the cancellation in this area.
* Both Waiver & Policy Forms (maybe?)    
 * Have you already signed and submitted those forms? A check box for both stating if you have. (are the forms required for each class you sign up for?) not for each class but to use the gym and fitness room. I guess this maybe something we can discuss with Nicole.
* A cancellation for class
* Sign up for multiple classes   ( ie picking multiple classes/times from a list and then signing up for all ?) Yes!
 * Email reminder 
    * Maybe to either go out the morning of or late afternoon the day before the class.
* Sign up for waitlist
 * The next person on the wait list to be emailed to see if they still want to go to that class.        (should there be a time limit on this so invites do not sit in a person’s inbox when they go on vacation… or they simply do not reply.  If the time limit expires they would be informed by another e-mail?).  Yes?.... How long should the time limit be for 2 hours?
    * Yes or No reply to said email. This will automatically update the attendee list.

### Admin Users (Nicole and I)
* Add and update the classes        
* Individually and multiple classes (by multiple classers do you mean a single type of class with multiple times?) Individual as in one type ie. Better Fit. Multiple classes ie. Better Fit, Super circuit etc.. I also like you option in addition to mine. 
* Printable day calendar of class attendees for instructor.


Additional Thoughts added After initial discusion (more recent talks)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
* A weekly view of classes showing a total of attendees per class
* anonymous feedback for people who took classes
* more detailed info for registrants to see
* info metric graphs for admin users about popularity of classes, etc over time
* history for users of what classes they have gone to, etc.
